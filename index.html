<br> Currently, I am a Research Scientist in the Audio research team at Pindrop. My role involves the development of a robust deepfake detection system, aimed at addressing real-world challenges. My research interests include Deepfake detection, Speaker recognition and Anti-spoofing.<br><br>

I graduated (Ph.D.) from Sorbonne University, France, worked in the Audio Security and Privacy group, supervised by <a
	href="https://www.eurecom.fr/en/people/evans-nicholas">Prof. Nicholas Evans</a>.
I have interned in the Voice-ID group at Amazon, USA in 2022.
