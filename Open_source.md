  <p>During PhD, I actively contribute to various projects. Below are some of my notable open source projects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/eurecom-asp/rawnet2-antispoofing">Project 1</a>: This repository contains our implementation of the paper accepted to ICASSP 2021, "End-to-end anti-spoofing with RawNet2". This work demonstrates the effectivness of end-to-end approaches that utilise automatic feature learning to improve performance, both for seen spoofing attack types as well as for worst-case (A17) unseen attack.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/eurecom-asp/RawGAT-ST-antispoofing">Project 2</a>: This repository contains our implementation of the paper published in the ASVspoof 2021 satellite workshop, "End-to-End Spectro-Temporal Graph Attention Networks for Speaker Verification Anti-Spoofing and Speech Deepfake Detection". This work demonstrates the effectivness of end-to-end spectro-temporal graph attention network (GAT) which learns the relationship between cues spanning different sub-bands and temporal intervals for anti-spoofing and speech deepfake detection.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/TakHemlata/SSL_Anti-spoofing">Project 3</a>: This repository contains our implementation of the paper published in the Speaker Odyssey 2022, "Automatic speaker verification spoofing and deepfake detection using wav2vec 2.0 and data augmentation". This work produced state-of-the-art result on more challenging ASVspoof 2021 LA and DF database.</li>
  </ul>
