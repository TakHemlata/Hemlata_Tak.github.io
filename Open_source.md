<p>During PhD, I actively contribute to various projects. Below are some of my notable open source projects:</p>
  <ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/eurecom-asp/rawnet2-antispoofing">Project 1</a>: This repository contains our implementation of the paper accepted to ICASSP 2021, "End-to-end anti-spoofing with RawNet2". This work demonstrates the effectivness of end-to-end approaches that utilise automatic feature learning to improve performance, both for seen spoofing attack types as well as for worst-case (A17) unseen attack.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/eurecom-asp/RawGAT-ST-antispoofing">Project 2</a>: This repository contains our implementation of the paper published in the ASVspoof 2021 satellite workshop, "End-to-End Spectro-Temporal Graph Attention Networks for Speaker Verification Anti-Spoofing and Speech Deepfake Detection". This work demonstrates the effectivness of end-to-end spectro-temporal graph attention network (GAT) which learns the relationship between cues spanning different sub-bands and temporal intervals for anti-spoofing and speech deepfake detection.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/TakHemlata/SSL_Anti-spoofing">Project 3</a>: This repository contains our implementation of the paper published in the Speaker Odyssey 2022, "Automatic speaker verification spoofing and deepfake detection using wav2vec 2.0 and data augmentation". This work produced state-of-the-art result on more challenging ASVspoof 2021 LA and DF database.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/TakHemlata/T-EER">Project 4</a>: In this repository we propose an extension to the widely-used 'equal error rate' (EER) performance metric which is still used across the field to assess the reliability of biometric systems. The new 'tandem' EER ("t-EER") metric can be used to assess the performance of presentation attack detectors (PADs) and biometric comparators jointly -- as opposed to evaluating the two systems in isolation. Informally, it's an "EER" for *two* detectors with their respective detection thresholds. As indicated in the title of our article, the t-EER metric is parameter free.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/TakHemlata/RawBoost-antispoofing">Project 5</a>: In this repository we propose RawBoost, a data-boosting and augmentation method to design more reliable spoofing detection solutions which operate directly upon raw waveform. RawBoost data-augmentation technique is based upon the combination of linear and non-linear filtering in addition to signal-dependent and signal-independent additive noises. The aim is to improve spoofing detection reliability in the face of nuisance variation stemming from unknown encoding and transmission conditions which typify telephony scenario. </li>
